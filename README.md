# cookunity-cli

An unofficial command-line interface for managing your [CookUnity](https://cookunity.com) meal subscription. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with CookUnity in any way.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap sergiosegrera/cookunity
brew install cookunity
```

### From source (requires [Bun](https://bun.com) v1.0+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiosegrera/cookunity-cli.git
cd cookunity-cli
bun install
bun src/index.ts <command>
```

## Setup

Set your credentials via environment variables:

```bash
export COOKUNITY_EMAIL=your@email.com
export COOKUNITY_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

Or put them in a `.env` file in your working directory (auto-loaded when running from source).

## Usage

All commands support `--json` for raw JSON output.

### Menu

```bash
cookunity menu [date]                   # Browse available meals
cookunity menu --category Bowls         # Filter by category
cookunity menu --diet vegan             # Filter by diet tag
cookunity menu --max-price 14           # Filter by price
cookunity menu --limit 10 --offset 20  # Pagination
cookunity search <keyword> [date]       # Search meals
cookunity meal <inventoryId> [--date]   # Full meal details
```

### Deliveries

```bash
cookunity deliveries        # List all upcoming deliveries
cookunity next              # Show next delivery
cookunity skip <date>       # Skip a delivery
cookunity unskip <date>
```

### Cart

cookunity cart show <date>
cookunity cart add <inventoryId> <date> [--qty 2]
cookunity cart remove <inventoryId> <date>
cookunity cart clear <date>
```

### Orders

```bash
cookunity order confirm <date>                          # Place order from cart
cookunity price [date]                                  # Price breakdown for current cart
cookunity orders                                        # List past orders
cookunity history [--from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD]  # Invoice history
```

### Account

```bash
cookunity user   # Account info, plan, addresses
```

## Limitations

- **Unofficial / reverse-engineered**: Uses CookUnity's internal GraphQL API, which is undocumented and may change without notice, breaking this tool.
- **No token persistence**: Authentication runs the full OAuth flow on each process start. Tokens are cached in memory for the duration of the session only.
- **Write operations at your own risk**: Commands that modify your order (cart, skip, confirm) interact with real orders and real charges.
- **Bun only**: The pre-built binary is self-contained, but running from source requires Bun — it will not run on Node.js.
- **Single account**: Credentials are read from environment variables; no multi-account support.
